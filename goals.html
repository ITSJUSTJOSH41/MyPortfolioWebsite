    <h2>Goals & Future Ambitions</h2>
    <p>Moving forward, I aim to strengthen my programming skills by coding passion projects and collaborating with others on interesting projects. As I build up my potfolio of projects, I plan to code useful applications and take on freelancing opportunities. Furthermore, I will work to find an internship in the coming months after building up my portfolio and range of skills a little bit more.<p>

		<p>The podcast above was made by a senior in college who managed to land a tech internship at a company called Secure Link. I found the podcast to be super insightful, as the host talks about 
		the interview process for a variety of internships he applied for and talks about some of the ways CS students can land internships. He also talks about some of the different approaches employers
		take in the interview process for tech positions and some of the reasons why he believes the interviewers may or may not have hired him.</p>
