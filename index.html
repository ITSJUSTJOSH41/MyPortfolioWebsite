        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Joshua Swanson and I am a 19 year old undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers University. I am interested in technology and enjoy
		working with others to create engaging and interesting projects. I enjoy learning about various emerging new technologies and have spent a good amount of time over
		the years working on various programming projects. In my free time, I enjoy going on walks and hikes, playing video games, and learning something new.</p>
		
		<h2>Website Information</h2>
		<p>The various pages on my site contain information regarding my experience in relation to technology and some of the projects and skills I have developed over
		the years. Furthermore, the site contains a page which speaks on some of my future ambitions/career goals, in addition to a page with important contact information.
		The primary purpose of the site is to get a basic preview of some of my technical abilities.</p>
		
		<h2>CS Video</h2>

		<p>The video above is a great overview of a variety of computer science topics. I find this video to be a great way to introduce people to computer science topics as the video touches on
		the different components of a computer and explains how key programming languages work. Furthermore, the video is fast-paced and pretty easy to digest, while still touching on many key CS topics
		such as how the cpu works, the different uses of programming languages, and how memory is stored.</p>
